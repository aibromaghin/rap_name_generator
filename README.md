# rap_name_generator

This project is a small Streamlit web app that serves as an introduction to LangChain. The project is based off of the pet name generator tutorial from Free Code Camp as part of their LangChain crash course at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG7Uxts9SXs&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org.
